# BACKGROUND 
A young girl, raised in a secluded village, had always been strong and kind. She 
lost her mother when she was very young and her father, the village chief, instilled in 
her a deep sense of responsibility. When the forest around her home began to wither 
and her people fell ill, an ancient prophecy was revealed: the World Tree was dying, and 
darkness loomed. As the chosen one, a bearer of light, she knew she had to act. With 
her father's blessing, she embarked on a perilous journey to save her village and the 
world.
